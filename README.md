## 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

![Project Cover](https://www2.0zz0.com/2025/07/31/09/777887199.jpg)

### 📌 Project Description  
This project demonstrates how to build a simple **Linear Regression** model using Python to predict **house prices** based on their **area in square feet**. The data is synthetic and assumes a direct linear relationship between area and price.

### 🧠 What’s Inside:
- Training a linear regression model using **scikit-learn**
- Visualizing the regression line and predictions
- Predicting the price of a house with a specific area
- Calculating **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate the model

### 🛠 Technologies Used:
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

### 📊 Sample Prediction:
> 📌 For a 1600 sq.ft house, the predicted price is approximately **\$800,000**.

### 📎 How to Run:
1. Clone the repository or open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to train the model and view results.
